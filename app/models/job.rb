# frozen_string_literal: true

# This class represents a unit of job performed inside a work order for a set of biomaterial
# inside a container. Any instance could take one of the following status depending on the
# situation:
#
# - queued    : The job is created, but not sent to a LIMS to start its work
# - active    : The job has started
# - completed : The job was completed. This status is set by the LIMS after finishing with it
# - cancelled : The job was cancelled before completing. Same as completed, it is set by the LIMS
# - broken    : The job is broken and cannot be modified anymore
#
# The state machine could be represented as following:
#
#                 (1)                     Methods to change status:
#   QUEUED ---------------- BROKEN        (1) broken!
#     |                  (1) |||          (2) start!
# (2) |      COMPLETED ------ ||          (3) complete!
#     | (3)/             (1)  ||          (4) cancel!
#   ACTIVE ------------------- |
#       (4)\             (1)   |
#            CANCELLED --------
